# Continuous Network Ping Monitor

Stupid Czech T-Mobile can't solve a problem with my network connection dropping every 20-30 minutes for almost 2 weeks now and they "can't see any problem in their system", so I wrote this for their so-called tech support.

This script continuously monitors the network ping and approximates download speed.
It's a rough approximation, I get 10x less on my 250Mbps network, but that's what you get when checking on a 1 MB file.

Would be happy if it helps you ðŸ˜‰.

## Usage

```bash
./network-ping-monitor.sh
```
